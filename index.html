		<p>Hello! My name is Corey. My background includes a long list of very mundane jobs. The most recent being Security Management at the ever changing "Big-Box Retailer", but after just shy of a decade of service I am ready to pivot into a more technology based career. Talk Dungeons and Dragons, or Video Games to me and you will quickly find yourself in a lengthy debate over strategies accomplishments. Show me something you've made yourself and we will discuss the tools and techniques used to get it perfect. I am a very passionate person when I dive into hobbies, which has driven me to take this new step in my career, and will continue to drive me to be a more varied person in my life.</p>
